### In this file I will specify the planned structure for the Quarto site, in order to have a better overview of what has to be done

## Home:
Here there will be an overall overview of what the FAIR-Battery project is and what the site is for, who it is for, and how it is structured.

## Fair Battery Project:
Here we will explain the different components and redirect people to the FBRC site for the actual manufacturing of the battery. It will be structured as follows:

- **Main page**: Explanation of what will follow on this page and a guide to the FBRC site.
- **Battery 101**
  - How a battery functions (e.g. anodic and cathodic reaction, electrolyte, open and close circuit, main basic concepts) (max 500 words)
  - properties of a functioning battery that can be used for energy storage (overpotential, internal resistance, etc) (max 500 words)
  - specific properties of flow batteries (300 words)
  - difference between a text cell and a battery
  - why developing a test cell is an important step in building a battery
- **Build** (only an overall list of the components and their function):
  1. Flow cell, gasket  
  2. Jig, reservoirs  
  3. Pumps  
  4. Microcontroller (for pumps?)
  5. Potentiostat (for charge and discharge)  
  6. Electrolyte solution
  7. Test load (for testing the battery without a potentiostat)
- **FBRC Project**
- **Testing**
- **Troubleshooting**
- **Beyond**

## Community:
Here we will provide a way for readers to reach out and communicate about the project.

## Contributing to FAIR-Battery:
Here we will explain how people can join the project, create a feature request, or report an issue.
