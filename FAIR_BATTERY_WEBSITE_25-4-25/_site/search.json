    "text": "It is important that all the components of the cell are inert to the electrolyte. Most of components of the cell are made of plastic, which won’t cause any trouble in a redoxreactive environment. However, depending on the material, the electrode can also react with components from the electrode. Change in material of the electrode might increase internal impedance or it is also possible the electrode dissolves.\nWithin this experiment, both the stability of current collectors and current conductors can be tested, based upon their resistance measured before and after exposure to the electrolyte.\n\n\n\nOhm meter\n2 thin copper plates\n\n\n\n\nFor a qualitative measurement, which serves more as sanity check, we take a picture of the collector/conductor. For the quantitative measurement, we first sand the surface of the copper plates until they are shiney. This is to remove the oxide layer which will otherwise lead to extra resistance on the copper plates. Put the chosen current collector or conductor between the two copper plates. Measure the ohmic resistance by pressing each electrodes of the ohmic meter against one of the copper plates. It is important that the copper plates do not have contact with each for this will short circuiting. It is also important to strongly press the electrodes against the copper plates for this will lead to better contact between the electrode and the copper plate, hence a better measurement of resistance.\nAfter measurement, we put the collector/conductor in a bath of the chosen electrolyte. The length of the bathing is dependable on measurements and will be explained later.\nIn the bathing period of the conductor/collector we both do qualitative and quantitative measurement.\nAs qualitative measurement, we take a picture of the conductor/collector. Differences between the pictures take at after different bathing lengths would indicate that the collector/conductor is unstable within the electrolyte. For the quantitative measurement, the entire routine above (including grind of the copper plates) should be repeated. An increase in resistance is proportional to how unstable the collector/conductor is in the electrolyte.\nThere are three scenarios in which the experiment can be regarded as finished: - There is a strong increase measured in resistance. This means the collector/conductor is not qualified to be used in the battery. - There is a flattening in increase in resistance over the last few measurements. This probably means the conductor/collector has reached a equilibrium within the electrolyte. You should decide if the increase in resistance can be worked with in a battery. - After a long period of time (we choose one week) the conductor/collector keeps increasing in resistance. This probably means the collector/conductor won’t reach an equilibrium and is not a good fit.\n\n\n\nBefore looking at our result, it should be mentioned that we didn’t conduct the experiment entirely like described above. We only did 2 measurements: one before the electrolyte bath and one after one week. We also noticed that different people performing the the resistance measurement lead to different results. Therefore we recommend to make sure to really give firm pressure when putting the electrode on the copper since this can gravely influence the results. In our case, we chose the lowest measured resistance to be the true.

If not, which adjustments are needed? - What is the missing know-how and expertise for kick-starting the local development of pilot projects? - How to set up a distributed manufacturing and maintenance infrastructure for electricity storage?\n\n\n2- Battery Hardware\nAs of April 2024, we have produced and tested an initial battery design with a geometric cell area of 1cm^2 with the possibility to scale up to 10 cm^2.\nMore detailed documentation and files can be found here\nThe current battery design has been tested using a MYSTAT, a small open-source potentiostat.\n\n\n3- Coordination and Maintenance\nA standard procedure for testing FAIR-Batteries is currently being developed.

    "text": "Compared to traditional batteries, where the anodes, cathodes, separators and electrolyte are all contained within one structure (think of the popular AA Battery), flow batteries have their electrolyte in separate electrolyte tanks, outside of the of the reaction cell. Whereas in traditional batteries the electrolyte is contained, flow batteries actively pump the electrolyte through an ion-selective membrane. This has a few advantages, such as that the capacity of a flow battery is easily scalable, for one can just increase the tank size and the electro-active materials are easily recoverable.\nFlow batteries are also stackable, where you can connect the two tanks to multiple cells to achieve a higher voltage.\nToo learn more about flow batteries, their advantages and implementations, click here!\n\n\n\n {width=“20%}” Fig. 1 A schematic example of a Redox Flow Battery. All components described in the legend can be found in every RFB. The V(V)/V(II) to V(IV)/V(III) redox reaction is used as an example.\n\n\nThe electrolyte in a redox-flow battery is the solution in the battery containing the chemical compounds which hold the (chemical) potential energy of the cell. This energy can be released when these compounds undergo a redox-reaction. Below an example is given of 2 half reactions which together add up to one redox reaction [2][4].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nReaction\nΔE\n\n\n\n\n1\nV3+ + e- → V2+\n- 0.255 V vs. SHE\n\n\n2\nVO2+ + H2O → VO2+ + 2 H+ + e-\n1.004 V vs. SHE\n\n\n3\nV2+ + 2 VO2+ + 4 H+ → V3+ + 2 VO2+ + 2 H2O\n1.259 V\n\n\n\nTable 1\nReaction 1 and 2 are the half reactions after which the electric potential is given. Reaction 3 is the total reaction. The theoretical electric potential of reaction 3 is the difference in electric potential of the half reactions. One can see these energies are given in V, which is J/C.\n\n\n\nFollowing the example of Table 1, if one would add V3+ and VO2+ into a solution without a membrane, the electron transfer of the oxidizer VO2+ to the reducer V3+ would happen at the side of the reaction. However, in an electrochemical battery, one controls the electron flow in order to use its energy. By putting putting a membrane between the solution containing the oxidizer and the solution containing the reducer, one doesn’t allow the the oxidizer and reducer to be in direct contact. The electron transfer is happens via the so called electrodes (see Fig.1). In Fig. 1 at 5, a device can be added to be powered in case of discharge of the battery. In Fig.1 at 5, the charger can be located upon charging of the battery.\nThe material of the membrane should be chosen to be non-reactive to the components in the of electrolyte and it should be permeable to the right components. One often used categorization for membranes is the distinction between anion- and cathion-exchanged membranes [1]. In general, cathion-exchanged membranes are used for high power density applications, while anion-exchanged membranes offer easier transport management and higher efficiency. Cathion and anion membranes can be categorized under ion exchange membranes, for they filter charged particles. Other types of membranes are porous seperators, bilayer membranes and asymmetric membranes [3].\n\n\n\nAs briefly stated before, the current collector is the material at which the half reactions within the electrolyte take place. It can either offer or take up electrons. The current collector where the reduction reaction takes place is called the cathode. The current collector where the oxidation reaction takes place is called the anode. When charging the battery, the cathode is labeled as negative and the anode as positive. Upon discharge, the cathode becomes positive and the anode becomes negative. In Fig. 1, a discharging battery is shown. If the direction of current would be turn around, i.e. the battery would be charged, the labeling would be change by switching 1 and 2.\nTo get back tot the example of the vanadium half reactions upon discharge of the cell; V3+ + e- → V2+ would take place on the cathode, while VO2+ + H2O → VO2+ + 2 H+ + e- takes place on the anode. A cell converting chemical energy to electric energy (discharging) is called a galvanic cell. A cell converting electric energy to chemical energy (charging) is called an electrolytic cell.\nThe current collectors should sathisfy a few characteristics, depending on their specific use: - They should be inert to the electrolyte. This usually involves being inert to acidic environmemts. - They should be able to both offer and take up electrons to and from the electrolyte. - They should be low resistance - Ideally the should be porous to offer a large surface for the half reactions to take place.\n\n\n\nThe current conductor is the part of the battery which conducts the current from the current collector to the other side of the cell.

    "text": "Compared to traditional batteries, where the anodes, cathodes, separators and electrolyte are all contained within one structure (think of the popular AA Battery), flow batteries have their electrolyte in separate electrolyte tanks, outside of the of the reaction cell. Whereas in traditional batteries the electrolyte is contained, flow batteries actively pump the electrolyte through an ion-selective membrane. This has a few advantages, such as that the capacity of a flow battery is easily scalable, for one can just increase the tank size and the electro-active materials are easily recoverable.\nFlow batteries are also stackable, where you can connect the two tanks to multiple cells to achieve a higher voltage.\nToo learn more about flow batteries, their advantages and implementations, click here!",

    "text": "{width=“20%}” Fig. 1 A schematic example of a Redox Flow Battery. All components described in the legend can be found in every RFB. The V(V)/V(II) to V(IV)/V(III) redox reaction is used as an example.\n\n\nThe electrolyte in a redox-flow battery is the solution in the battery containing the chemical compounds which hold the (chemical) potential energy of the cell. This energy can be released when these compounds undergo a redox-reaction. Below an example is given of 2 half reactions which together add up to one redox reaction [2][4].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nReaction\nΔE\n\n\n\n\n1\nV3+ + e- → V2+\n- 0.255 V vs. SHE\n\n\n2\nVO2+ + H2O → VO2+ + 2 H+ + e-\n1.004 V vs. SHE\n\n\n3\nV2+ + 2 VO2+ + 4 H+ → V3+ + 2 VO2+ + 2 H2O\n1.259 V\n\n\n\nTable 1\nReaction 1 and 2 are the half reactions after which the electric potential is given. Reaction 3 is the total reaction. The theoretical electric potential of reaction 3 is the difference in electric potential of the half reactions. One can see these energies are given in V, which is J/C.\n\n\n\nFollowing the example of Table 1, if one would add V3+ and VO2+ into a solution without a membrane, the electron transfer of the oxidizer VO2+ to the reducer V3+ would happen at the side of the reaction. However, in an electrochemical battery, one controls the electron flow in order to use its energy. By putting putting a membrane between the solution containing the oxidizer and the solution containing the reducer, one doesn’t allow the the oxidizer and reducer to be in direct contact. The electron transfer is happens via the so called electrodes (see Fig.1). In Fig. 1 at 5, a device can be added to be powered in case of discharge of the battery. In Fig.1 at 5, the charger can be located upon charging of the battery.\nThe material of the membrane should be chosen to be non-reactive to the components in the of electrolyte and it should be permeable to the right components. One often used categorization for membranes is the distinction between anion- and cathion-exchanged membranes [1]. In general, cathion-exchanged membranes are used for high power density applications, while anion-exchanged membranes offer easier transport management and higher efficiency. Cathion and anion membranes can be categorized under ion exchange membranes, for they filter charged particles. Other types of membranes are porous seperators, bilayer membranes and asymmetric membranes [3].\n\n\n\nAs briefly stated before, the current collector is the material at which the half reactions within the electrolyte take place. It can either offer or take up electrons. The current collector where the reduction reaction takes place is called the cathode. The current collector where the oxidation reaction takes place is called the anode. When charging the battery, the cathode is labeled as negative and the anode as positive. Upon discharge, the cathode becomes positive and the anode becomes negative. In Fig. 1, a discharging battery is shown. If the direction of current would be turn around, i.e. the battery would be charged, the labeling would be change by switching 1 and 2.\nTo get back tot the example of the vanadium half reactions upon discharge of the cell; V3+ + e- → V2+ would take place on the cathode, while VO2+ + H2O → VO2+ + 2 H+ + e- takes place on the anode. A cell converting chemical energy to electric energy (discharging) is called a galvanic cell. A cell converting electric energy to chemical energy (charging) is called an electrolytic cell.\nThe current collectors should sathisfy a few characteristics, depending on their specific use: - They should be inert to the electrolyte. This usually involves being inert to acidic environmemts. - They should be able to both offer and take up electrons to and from the electrolyte. - They should be low resistance - Ideally the should be porous to offer a large surface for the half reactions to take place.\n\n\n\nThe current conductor is the part of the battery which conducts the current from the current collector to the other side of the cell. This can be the same material as the current collector, but could also be another material.\nThe current conductor should sathisfy the following characteristics: - It have a low resistance - If the conductor is a different material than the current collector, there should be a good electron transmission between the material of the current collector and transmission\n\n\n\nThe pump is located outside of the cell. The pump chooses the direction and speed of the electrlyte flow. The system contains one pump per halfcell.",

    "text": "This protocol is meant to test the battery’s’ voltage as function of time and used capacity. This document is based on the section “Charge–discharge testing” in O’Connor, 2021 [1]. This experiment should generally be applicable for any redox-flow battery. However, the values for voltages and currents we use in this document consider the use of a vanadium redox-flow battery (VRFB).\n\n\n\n\nNegative tank The tank containing the V(II)/V(III) solution (violet/green)\nPositive tank The tank containing the V(V)/V(IV) solution (yellow/blue). This solution might be black instead of colored.\nV3.5 is a short way describe two electrolytes, one contains V(III) (no V(II)) and the other contains the same amount of V(IV) (no V(V)).\nVRFB Vanadium redox-flow battery\n\n\n\n\n\nVRFB\n(Optionally) Potentiostat\nProgrammable power Supply (TTi QL335P linear regulated power)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen performing this experiment, the system should be kept anaerobe to prevent oxidation of formed V(II). This can be done by putting a humidified nitrogen or argon stream through the negative tank. Another option is to apply a film of paraffin oil on top of the electrolytes in the tanks [3]. This doesn’t require you to supply the cell with constant nitrogen or argon stream. However, parts of the cell that are not airtight might still allow oxygen into the system, which won’t be expelled when only using a paraffin oil and no nitrogen or argon stream.\nIt is important to not make the entire battery airtight. In the cell hydrogen might be formed. If the entire battery is airtight, the battery can explode. We can enable the system to release overpressure using an overpressure valve.\n\n\n\nThis experiment contains chronopotentiometry: charging and discharging the battery with constant current and with that measuring the voltage as a function of time. Upon charge the current should be positive, upon discharge the current will be negative.\nBased on the color of your electrolytes, it’s possible to know the sign of the current you should start with. If your electrolytes are black/yellow and purple, then your battery is charged. This means you should start with a negative current. If your electrolytes are blue/black and green, it means your battery is discharged. In this case you should start with a positive current.\nThe amount of current run through the battery cell is dependent on the size of your membrane. Use a 25 ml min-1 flow rate of the electrolytes through the cell of and keep this rate constant over the experiment. In [O’Connor, 2021] the current per area is ± 50 mA cm2.\nThe charge-discharge cycles will cycle between 1.75 V (charging) and 1.10 V (discharging). When reaching these voltages, the direction of the current needs to be reversed.\n\nThese cycles can take quite some time. Best would be to have a tracking system, which can track the important quantities for you: voltage (V), time (s), current (A) and optionally capacity (A.h). A device which could track these values would be a computer controlled potentiostat, which can also perform the cycles. It might be possible that you do not own a potentiostat or your potentiostat can’t reach the voltages required the perform these experiments. Performing one cycle by hand with a programmable power supply would suffice. However, the more cycles you track, the more you will know about your battery.\nIt is possible that the potentiostat or powersupply can’t show the capacity. In that case, you can determine the capacity by integrating the absolute values current over time. You can plot the data as voltage and current versus time. Another way to show the data is to plot voltage versus capacity.\nIn the folder of this document, there will be a folder called “Script_plots”. This folder contains a python script “Script_plots.py” which calculates the plot the data for you. There is an instruction file on how to use this script “Instructions_script.md”.\nIn case you’re using a potentiostat, make sure it can supply high enough currents and voltages. If it can, it will probably come accompanied by a software program which can generate the necessary data in plots for you.\n\n\n\n\nIn our experiments we noticed that the electrolyte sometimes turned black. In our case this was the positive electrolyte. Our hypothesis is that this happens due to some of the electrode (carbon) being dispersed in the acidic electrolyte. The reason why this happens on the positive side and not the negative can be explained by looking at the half reactions happening upon charging:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nReaction\nΔE\n\n\n\n\n1\nV3+ + e- → V2+\n- 0.255 V vs. SHE\n\n\n2\nV(IV)O2+ + H2O → V(V)O2+ + 2 H+ + e-\n1.004 V vs. SHE\n\n\n\nIn reaction 1 there is no generation of H+. This half reaction corresponds to the negative electrolyte. Reaction 2 shows generation of 2 H+. This half reaction corresponds to the positive electrolyte. The generation of H+ lowers the pH of the positive side the battery cell. This phenomenon in combination with high potentials on the electrode could lead to dissolvement of the electrode on the positive side. In case of proton blocking membrane, the pH of the negative electrolyte stays the same.\n\n\n\n[1] O’Connor, H., Bailey, J. J., Istrate, O. M., Klusener, P.

For more detailed specifications, please refer to the FBRC website, linked in the FBRC section of this document.\n\n\nThe flow cell serves as the core of the battery system, where the crucial redox reactions take place, and the electrical current is generated. This component is integral to the functionality of the entire setup, as it facilitates the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy.\n\n\n\nBrass and Grafoil Current Collectors: As discussed in the “Battery 101” section, current collectors are responsible for either accepting or donating electrons during the redox process. In this design, we use a combination of brass and grafoil. Brass is highly conductive, making it an excellent choice for current collection, while grafoil, under standard conditions, is chemically inert to the electrolyte, ensuring longevity and stable performance.\nPorous Graphite Felt: The porous graphite felt acts as the conductor within the flow cell. Its porous structure is key, as it provides a high surface area, allowing for increased reaction efficiency. This makes it ideal for facilitating the flow of electrons and ions during the redox process.\nSeparator Sheet Membrane: A critical component in electrochemical cells, the separator sheet membrane prevents direct contact between the different solutions in the flow cell,. In this setup, photo paper is used as the membrane due to its availability and cost-effectiveness.\n\nHere are some images of the flow cell:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo control the flow of the electrolyte solution within the system, two pumps are utilized. These pumps are connected to two reservoirs that hold the electrolyte solutions, and the flow rate is carefully regulated.\n\n\n\nPeristaltic Pumps: Small peristaltic pumps are employed in this project.

    "text": "The first testing the quality of a battery is testing of three quantities of the battery: - The charge/discharge-efficiency. - The overpotential as a function of current run through the battery. Knowing the relation between overpotential and current can tell you something about the internal resistance of the battery and the ideal current for best performance of the battery. - The terminal voltage as a function of time\n\n\n\nProgrammable power Supply (TTi QL335P linear regulated power)\nDigilent Analog Discovery 2\nPstrace 5.9 by Palmsens (software)\nA rechargeable battery\n\n\n\n\nIn a system with no internal resistance, the current or potential through a resistor (or device) can be determined using Ohm’s law:\n   (equation 1)\nWhere U is the potential in V, I the electrical current in A and R the resistance in Ω. However, the device attached to the battery is not the only resistor in the circuit. The wiring to the the device from the cell and the cell itself also have resistance lowering the voltage through the device upon discharge. This resistance within the circuit is called the internal resistance Rint. The voltage over the battery within the circuit, considering internal restance, is called the terminal voltage Uterm. Upon discharge, Uterm is lower than the electric potential supplied by the chemical reaction within the battery because part of this potential is “claimed” by the internal resistance of the circuit. The electric potential supplied by the battery to the system is called the electromotive force ε. The terminal voltage can be calculated using the following equation [1]:\n   (equation 2)\nNote that the electromotive force ε is not an actual force but has the unit V (J/C). Upon discharge, Uterm is the potential put on the external device. The ±-sign is then a minus, since the potential on the external device is lower than the potential supplied by the battery.\nUpon charge, Uterm is the potential supplied by the charging device. The ±-sign is then a plus, because an overpotential is required to supply the voltage ε to the battery.\nAlso note that when Rint → 0, Uterm becomes ε. It is required to apply a current to measure the voltage in a circuit. This means it is only possible to acquire ε through extrapolation of measurements of Uterm as a function of I.\nConsidering equation 2 and that that power P = U * I, we can calculate the current at which the power supply of the battery peaks:\n   (equation 3)\n\n\n\nThe charge/discharge efficiency is a measurement of efficiency in energy. The charge/discharge efficiency can be calculated using the following equation:\n   (equation 4)\nIf your power supply can register the total energy it has used to charge the battery, there’s no need to use the third and forth part of the equation and you can just fill the used energy for charging in Ein.\nIf your power supply doesn’t show Ein, you’ll need to perform an integration on the used power. In the equation the quantities followed by (t), are the quantities which will need to be integrated over time. If your power supply can register you the used power in W, you’ll need to register the value of the power at periodically while charging. If your power supply only can show the voltage and current, you’ll need to register the current instead, given that the voltage is kept constant. The shorter the time interval of registering the power/current, the more precise the charge/discharge efficiency will be. It won’t be necessary to choose a set time interval. If the current is changing fast over time, it is best to register the often register the current. If the power/current is relatively constant in time, the time interval of registering its value can be longer.\nThere is a python script within the same folder as this document, which performs an Euler integration. Instructions on how to open and use the script are given in a txt-file in the same folder as the script.\n\n\nIt is now time to charge the battery. Since the efficiency is a quantity of interest, it is important to do this at a voltage as low as possible. It is also a goal to charge the battery as fast as possible. To do both satisfy these commands, we do the following:\nWe choose to vary the current. We start off at a current of 20 mA and slowly increase the current. To make sure we get a good efficiency and also prevent (too many) other half reactions from happening, we put a maximum voltage limit on the power supply of 1.43 V.\nTo measure Eout, we use the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 to measure the terminal voltage of the battery as a function of time at fixed current upon discharge. We discharge the cell with a current of 100 mA. In project_instructions.md, it is described how to do this using the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 and Pstrace 5.9. Again, the python script in the same folder as this document can be used to integrate the voltage to find the energy.\n\n\n\n\nFor this measurement, we charge the battery again. How to do this is described above at “Charging of the battery”.\nEquation 2 shows the terminal potential will decrease as a fucntion of current run through the battery. The scale of this drop down is unknown beforehand. To get a sense of this scale of the voltage as a function of current, we first conduct the following experiment:\nFirst, we charge the battery. We then manually start at a current as low as possible and wait until the voltage becomes stable. Once stable, we increase the current and wait for the voltage to become stable again. We increase this step until we can make an educated gues on where the voltage goes to zero. Using the script, plot_overpotential.py from the Script_plot_overpotential folder, we plot our results. Instructions on how to use this script are within the same folder.\nWe then let the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 perform the same experiment. However, the charging of the battery is performed by hand again. The rest of the experiment can be performed using multistep potentiometry in Pstrace 5.9. How to use this program, project_instructions.md can be consulted. We chose the range of current to be at least 10% higher than where we determined that the voltage went to zero. We determine the time interval from how long it took for the voltage to become stable in last experiment. We chose the amount of measurements per time interval to be 2. When the measurements turn out be significantly differ from each other at same current, the amount of measurements should be increased in a future experiments.\n\n\n\nFor this measurement, we charge the battery again. How to do this is described above at “Charging of the battery”.\nWe first charge the battery. By letting a constant current of 100 mA go through the battery, we measure the voltage as a function time. This can be done using a\n\n\n\nThis document should be merged with the project_instructions.md document, which describes how to actually measure the standard potential.\nGive a value for at what current the battery should discharge. 100 mA is an arbitrarily chosen value. Also give the name of the program of the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 you need to use if you want to know voltage as a function of time.\nEquation 4: U_term(t) instead of I(t), Pcharge instead of P_in, I also requires subscript\nDetermine when charging of a battery is completed.\nFind out the name of the program in Pstrace 5.9 for determining the voltage as a function of time and find out how it works. Then finish the subsection: “Terminal voltage as a function of time”.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Mahesh Shenoy (2021), Cells, EMF, terminal voltage & internal resistance, Khan Acadamy, https://www.khanacademy.org/science/in-in-class-12th-physics-india/in-in-current-electricity/x51bd77206da864f3:cell-emf-terminal-voltage-internal-resistance/v/cells-emf-terminal-voltage-internal-resistance",

    "text": "There are 3 places which need to be filled in (under FILL IN in the script):\n\n\nI, the current in mA\nt, the time in s\nU, the voltages in V\n\nAs you can see in the script behind t and U there are brackets. You can fill all your measurements within the brackets. The iteration of your measurement needs to match the iteration in the bracket. Here is an example:\nYou have performed 3 measurements: 1. I = 1250 mA, t = 10 s, U = 1.40 V 2. I = 1250 mA, t = 100 s, U = 1.43 V 3. I = 1250 mA, t = 200 s, U = 1.44 V\nIn the script, you would fill it in like this:\nI = [1250, 1250, 1250]\nt = [10, 100, 200]\nU = [1.40, 1.43, 1.44]\n\nIf you want to save the plots you are about to make into the same folder as this script, put above the script behind Save True, instead of False.\nRun the script. There is a button for this somewhere above, but you can also use the shortcut F5.\nA plot is made of both voltage and current as a function of time. Also a plot is made of the voltage as a function of capacity."

On this page we will provide the following tests you can perform:\n\nFirst testing and charging of the battery: Here you will test:\n\n\nThe charge/discharge-efficiency.\nThe overpotential as a function of current run through the battery. Knowing the relation between overpotential and current can tell you something about the internal resistance of the battery and the ideal current for best performance of the battery.\nThe terminal voltage as a function of time\n\n\nCharge and discharge testing: Here you will test the battery’s’ voltage as function of time and used capacity.\nStability electrode: Here you will test the stability of current collectors and current conductors can be tested, based upon their resistance measured before and after exposure to the electrolyte.\n\nThe codes and complementary instructions for these experiments are provided below, where the numbering corresponds to the experiment with the same number given above:\n\n\n\nIntructions plot overpotential\nScript plot overpotential\nInstructions charge discharge efficiency\nScript charge discharge efficiency\n\n\n\n\nInstructions charge discharge script\nScript charge discharge plot\n\n\n\n\n\nTo perform these tests, you will need the appropriate software to run all necessary programs.
