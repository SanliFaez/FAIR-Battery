{"title":"Testing your battery cell","markdown":{"headingText":"Testing your battery cell","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nNow that you have build your cell, you will be able to test and access whether it is working properly. On this page we will provide the following tests you can perform:\n\n1.  **First testing and charging of the battery**: Here you will test:\n\n-   The charge/discharge-efficiency.\n-   The overpotential as a function of current run through the battery. Knowing the relation between overpotential and current can tell you something about the internal resistance of the battery and the ideal current for best performance of the battery.\n-   The terminal voltage as a function of time\n\n2.  **Charge and discharge testing**: Here you will test the battery's' voltage as function of time and used capacity.\n3.  **Stability electrode**: Here you will test the stability of current collectors and current conductors can be tested, based upon their resistance measured before and after exposure to the electrolyte.\n\nThe codes and complementary instructions for these experiments are provided below, where the numbering corresponds to the experiment with the same number given above:\n\n1.  <div>\n\n    -   [Intructions plot overpotential](./instructions_plot_overpotential.html)\n\n    -   [Script plot overpotential](./Script_plot_overpotential.py)\n\n    -   [Instructions charge discharge efficiency](./Instructions_charge_discharge_efficiency.html)\n\n    -   [Script charge discharge efficiency](./Script_Charge_discharge_efficiency.py)\n\n    </div>\n\n2.  <div>\n\n    -   [Instructions charge discharge script](./Instructions_script.html)\n\n    -   [Script charge discharge plot](./Script_plots.py)\n\n    </div>\n\n## Software installation\n\nTo perform these tests, you will need the appropriate software to run all necessary programs. Follow the instructions below to proceed.\n\n\\* As a \"Hello World' this page will be going through the basic startup process, to get you up and running as soon as possible. For general installation steps see :doc:`software installation`.\n\nWarning: Not yet tried on linux, although the steps should be very similar to the \"For Mac\" section. \\*\n\n### For Mac\n\nFirst you will need to install the waveforms SDK. It can be downloaded from the `Digilent site <https://mautic.digilentinc.com/waveforms-download>`\\_.\n\nNOTE: In the installer dragging the app to Applications is optional, but the \"Waveforms SDK\" MUST be added to your frameworks!\n\nYou need to have `git <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#:~:text=To%20install%20Git%2C%20run%20the,installation%20by%20typing%3A%20git%20version%20.>`\\_ installed first. Then in a terminal:\n\n.. code::\n\n```         \ncd parent/directory/of/project\ngit clone https://github.com/SanliFaez/FAIR-Battery.git\n```\n\nNext you need to have `python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`\\_ and `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`\\_ installed. Verify this by running the following:\n\n.. code::\n\n```         \npython3 --version\npip3 --version\n```\n\nIf all is well, these will both return a version number, otherwise please install them before continuing.\n\nNOTE: If these don't work, try using \"`python`\" and \"`pip`\" instead. If these work (and show the correct latest versions) use them instead the version with a \"3\" for the rest of this guide.\n\nNext complete the installation by running:\n\n.. code::\n\n```         \ncd FAIR-Battery/\npip3 install -r Battery_Testing_Software/requirements.txt\n```\n\nIf this completes successfully, you should be ready to open up some testing software.\n\nFirst connect the usb of the AD2, then in path FAIR-Battery/ run:\n\n.. code::\n\n```         \nexport PYTHONPATH=.\npython3 Battery_Testing_Software/examples/101_project/BatteryTest_View.py\n```\n\n### For Windows\n\nFirst you will need to install the waveforms SDK. It can be downloaded from the `Digilent site <https://mautic.digilentinc.com/waveforms-download>`\\_.\n\nNOTE: In the installer choosing the app is optional, but the \"Waveforms SDK\" is mandatory!\n\nNext you need to have `git <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#:~:text=To%20install%20Git%2C%20run%20the,installation%20by%20typing%3A%20git%20version%20.>`\\_ installed first. Then in CMD:\n\n.. code::\n\n```         \ncd C:\\parent\\directory\\of\\project\ngit clone https://github.com/SanliFaez/FAIR-Battery.git\n```\n\nNext you need to have `python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`\\_ and `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`\\_ installed.\n\nMake sure to check the \"Add Python #.# to PATH\" option when installing!\n\nVerify this by running the following:\n\n.. code::\n\n```         \npython3 --version\npip3 --version\n```\n\nIf all is well, these will both return a version number, otherwise please install them before continuing.\n\nNOTE: If these don't work, try using \"`python`\" and \"`pip`\" instead. If these work (and show the correct latest versions) use them instead the version with a \"3\" for the rest of this guide.\n\nNOTE: If this isn't working after installation, perhaps python is not yet `added to path <https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/add-a-directory-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10/>`\\_.\n\nNext complete the installation by running:\n\n.. code::\n\n```         \ncd FAIR-Battery\npip3 install -r Battery_Testing_Software\\requirements.txt\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Testing.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
