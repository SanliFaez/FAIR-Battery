How to contribute
*****************

We are currently testing and troubleshooting the first beta release. There is no written roadmap, or any
long-term plan except for fixing all the glitches in the current code. If you see room for improvement
and would like to scratch your itch, please feel free to contact `Sanli Faez <mailto:s.faez@uu.nl>`_ and get involved in making this project grow.

Other small issues can be reported via the `issue tracker <https://github.com/SanliFaez/FAIR-Battery/issues>`_

Adding examples
---------------
If you have customized labphew for your own project, please consider stripping your additional code in to
a simplified example that can be added to the examples.
