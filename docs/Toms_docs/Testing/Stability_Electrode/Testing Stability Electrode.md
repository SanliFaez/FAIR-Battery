# Testing Stability Electrode
It is important that all the components of the cell are inert to the electrolyte. Most of components of the cell are made of plastic, which won't cause any trouble in a redoxreactive environment. However, depending on the material, the electrode can also react with components from the electrode. Change in material of the electrode might  increase internal impedance or it is also possible the electrode dissolves. \
Within this experiment, both the stability of current collectors and current conductors can be tested, based upon their resistance measured before and after exposure to the electrolyte.

## List of Material
- Ohm meter
- 2 thin copper plates

## Experimental setup
For a qualitative measurement, which serves more as sanity check, we take a picture of the collector/conductor.
For the quantitative measurement, we first sand the surface of the copper plates until they are shiney. This is to remove the oxide layer which will otherwise lead to extra resistance on the copper plates.
Put the chosen current collector or conductor between the two copper plates. Measure the ohmic resistance by pressing each electrodes of the ohmic meter against one of the copper plates. It is important that the copper plates do not have contact with each for this will short circuiting. It is also important to strongly press the electrodes against the copper plates for this will lead to better contact between the electrode and the copper plate, hence a better measurement of resistance.\
After measurement, we put the collector/conductor in a bath of the chosen electrolyte. The length of the bathing is dependable on measurements and will be explained later.\
In the bathing period of the conductor/collector we both do qualitative and quantitative measurement. \
As qualitative measurement, we take a picture of the conductor/collector. Differences between the pictures take at after different bathing lengths would indicate that the collector/conductor is unstable within the electrolyte.
For the quantitative measurement, the entire routine above (including grind of the copper plates) should be repeated. An increase in resistance is proportional to how unstable the collector/conductor is in the electrolyte. \
There are three scenarios in which the experiment can be regarded as finished:
- There is a strong increase measured in resistance. This means the collector/conductor is not qualified to be used in the battery.
- There is a flattening in increase in resistance over the last few measurements. This probably means the conductor/collector has reached a equilibrium within the electrolyte. You should decide if the increase in resistance can be worked with in a battery.
- After a long period of time (we choose one week) the conductor/collector keeps increasing in resistance. This probably means the collector/conductor won't reach an equilibrium and is not a good fit.


## Our Conduction of the Experiment
Before looking at our result, it should be mentioned that we didn't conduct the experiment entirely like described above. We only did 2 measurements: one before the electrolyte bath and one after one week. We also noticed that different people performing the the resistance measurement lead to different results. Therefore we recommend to make sure to really give firm pressure when putting the electrode on the copper since this can gravely influence the results. In our case, we chose the lowest measured resistance to be the true. This is because a higher resistance can be assigned to bad contact between the electrodes and copper plates.

### What should be added to this document?
- We are not entirely satisfied with how we conducted this experiment ourselves. This means we yet have to conduct this experiment ourselves as well. At the moment, this document should be regarded as an experiment proposal.
- The values measured in our experiment are not put in the table.
- Finish List of Materials.
- At scenario 2 for the finished electrodes, we would like to be able to give a more concrete indication for impedance at an electrode which is still acceptable.
