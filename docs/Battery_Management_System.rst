Battery Management System
============================

The battery will lose capacity due to side reactions happening within
electrolyte. By rebalancing the electrolyte, the capacity of the battery
can partly be restored. When actually using the battery, it would be impractical
if the user would need to replace/rebalance the electrolyte. A system
doing that can check the imbalance and rebalance it by itself would make
the battery qualified to be used over many cycles. Such battery management system
is called a regenerator. We're currently not working
ourselves on regenerator, but on our JOGL page, we set a challenge to
develop one:
