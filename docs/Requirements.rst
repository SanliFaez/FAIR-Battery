Requirements
=============

The battery should follow the four letters of FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reproducible). On a more technical side, there are a few
challenges in the development of the battery. We assign these challenges
in a challenge and project format on our JOGL page
( https://app.jogl.io/space/fairbattery). These consist of:

-   **Battery management:**, how do we use the battery and make it
    reusable over a large amount of time.
-   **Test cell:** In order for the development of the battery we need
    a study test cell, which can hold the electrolyte and can be used
    for testing different parts of the battery all at once.
-   **Regenerator:** over different charge and discharge cycles, it is
    likely that the capacity of the battery will decrease due to an
    imbalance in the electrolyte caused by side reactions. A regenarator
    will rebalance the battery to maintain a high capacity.
-   **A 3D-printed test cell:** In O'Connor, 2022 [1], a test cell is
    developed using 3D-printed parts. Building this battery using their
    instructions and making a clear and easy to follow documentation
    of this process would be of help in development of the a battery cell.
-   **Testing** the quality of a battery can be tested according to
    several measurable quantities like voltage as a function of time or
    used capacity.
    New ideas for measurable quantities which can test the workings of
    the battery are also welcome.
-   **Vanadium electrolyte:** currently, working vanadium electrolytes
    do exist. However, the recipes of the electrolytes are kept secret
    by the companies making these electrolytes. The goal would be the
    make an open source vanadium electrolyte recipe.
