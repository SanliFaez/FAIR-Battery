Pre-build Testing
====================

Before building the battery cell it is important to test the materials.
These can be tested on:

-   **Durability:** the components of the battery should be non-reactive
    with the electrolyte
-   **Conductivity:** the electron conductors/collectors, membrane and
    and electrolyte should have a low resistance, also when assembled
    in the cell

Testing Durability
------------------
Durability testing of the materials is partly based on O'Connor, 2022 [1].
First check the resistance and mass of the material.
Also make a picture of the material and try to describe the surface in
words as a qualitative measurement.
Make sure to have good contact
between the material and the electrodes of resistance measurement
apparatus by pressing hard on the material with the electrodes.
This might not be possible to do with the membrane, which can be
quite fragile.

After testing the resistance and mass put the material in a bath of electrolyte
solution for one week.

Clean the material using demi water, since the electrolyte might be
corrosive.
Again, test the mass and resistance of the material. Also make a picture
of the material for the qualitative comparisment. Any difference with
the material pre-bath indicates the material being reactive to the electrolyte.
A qualified material for the cell should be non-reactive. The most important
quantity that should remain constant is mass. For electrode conductor/collector
and membrane should also remain low in resistance to be qualified.
