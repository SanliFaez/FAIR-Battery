In the *FAIR-Battery* FAIR-Battery project, we aim to create an open-source electrochemical battery
(FAIR = Findable + Accessible + Interoperable + Reproducible).

FAIR-Battery is meant to be:
-----------------------
+ Open-source: all designs and data that is useful for further development will be shared
+ Scalable: both small and medium scale installations are supported and considered in new designs
+ Versatile: alternative chemistries or material resources will be accommodated as much as possible


You can find the code of this package on `Github <https://github.com/sanlifaez/FAIR-Battery>`_.
The documentation is hosted on `Read The Docs <https://fair-battery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#>`_.
