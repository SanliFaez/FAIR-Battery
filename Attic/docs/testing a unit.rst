Testing a Unit  [WIP]
****************************
Once a full cell has been assembled, it must be tested in order to compare it to other designs or chemistries.
Below are some important metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of a battery:

Important metrics when measuring batteries:
--------------------------------------------------

- Charge / Discharge at CC characteristics
- Impedance Spectroscopy
- Coulumbic efficiency
- Capacity
- Lifetime cycling
- Polarization at various current outputs
- Cyclic voltammetry
