# Testing your battery cell

Now that you have build your test cell, it is ready for testing! For this we refer you to again to the [FBRC development website](https://fbrc.codeberg.page/rfb-dev-kit/testing.html).

A short summary of what the experiment will entail:

-   **Leak testing the cell**: To ensure that your test cell has been properly assembled, it is essential to perform a leak test. This step will help you verify that all components are sealed correctly and that no electrolyte will escape during operation.

-   **Operating and testing the cell**: Once your test cell has passed the leak check, the next step involves initiating its operation. Begin by carefully adding the appropriate electrolyte into your battery. After the electrolyte has been added, it should be pre-circulated throughout the entire cell system. Only after this pre-circulation process should you proceed to apply an electrical current. At this stage, connect your test cell to the potentiostat. Once the connection is established, you will then define the specific cycling conditions under which the cell will be tested.
