# Contributing

As of now, there is no direct way to actively contribute to the FAIR-Battery project. However, the Flow Battery Research Collective (FBRC), which collaborates closely with FAIR-Battery, maintains an active [contribution page](https://fbrc.dev/contributing.html). This is a great starting point for anyone interested in supporting the shared goals of both projects.
