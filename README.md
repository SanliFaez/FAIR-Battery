Hardware, design, and a learning community for building an open-hardware redox-flow battery from the [Center for Unusual Collaborations](https://www.unusualcollaborations.com/)

In the _FAIR-Battery_ project, we aim to create an open-source electrochemical battery (FAIR = Findable + Accessible + Interoperable + Reproducible).
We seek to present an open-hardware platform for a versatile battery technology and make the platform radically accessible:
1- by deliberately using low-cost and locally available materials suitable for local user groups, and
2- by setting up the education communities on top of the open-hardware design.

On this route, we strive to not only provide the necessary technical details for engineering and production but also incorporate the local constraints for actually adopting and using the technology.
These constraints relate to language, availability of materials and expertise, maintenance capacity, or other locally varying conditions, which must be identified as part of the project.
Our envisioned FAIR-Battery platform will track and seek to remove these constraints in each stage of the development by direct consultation with the user groups.

## Contributing

:construction: This repository is always a work in progress and **everyone** is encouraged to help us build something useful to the many. :construction:

We are currently setting up the onboarding instructions for persistent contributors.

The GitHub issues and pull-request functions are currently _not_ actively used for updates.
These will be incorporated into the development procedures at a later stage

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.
Contributions of any kind are welcome!

## Project pillars

In our vision, to create a truly accessible FAIR-Battery, we need to form a community, at the same time that we collect and share the technical knowledge necessary for making and maintaining an operational device.
Therefore, we are building our activities on three pillars

### 1- Learning together

In this project, we will bring anthropologists, engineers, chemists,
 economists, and potential local users together to identify the barriers to developing a truly FAIR-battery and envision the first steps to removing some of these barriers in a follow-up project.
In particular, we look for the answers to these questions:
- What range of energy storage capacities are required for the development of typical user groups and at what cost?
- Which battery technologies can potentially address these demands?
- Are the materials and technologies required for adopting the identified technologies available in the identified user groups? If not, which adjustments are needed?
- What is the missing know-how and expertise for kick-starting the local development of pilot projects?

To investigate these questions, together with an inclusive community, we will develop:
- A. a starters' kit (hardware and software)
- B. a lecture series for self-study


### 2- Battery Hardware

As of April 2024, we have produced and tested an initial battery design with a geometric cell area of 1 cm^2 with the possibility to scale up to 10 cm^2.

More detailed documentation and files can be found [here](https//codeberg.org/FBRC/RFB-dev-kit)

### 3- Testing and Maintenance

A standard procedure for testing FAIR-Batteries is currently being developed. The main purpose of this standardization is to make
results from different contributing groups easy to compare. In order to achieve this, both software and hardware has been developed to fit the testing needs of redox-flow batteries.

_Software for Battery Testing_

We have developed an open-srouce python code that works on any major computer platform.
You can check the installation guide and further documentation on [readthedocs](https://fair-battery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The software is a fork of the Labphew project: https://github.com/SanliFaez/labphew.

### Hardware for Battery Testing

The current battery design can be tested and cycled using a MYSTAT, a small open-source potentiostat.
