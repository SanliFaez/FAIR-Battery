# Build Guide

Now that you've gained a clear understanding of how the battery operates, you're ready to take the next step â€” **building your very own flow battery**! 

Instead of providing step-by-step instructions here, we redirect you to the **Flow Battery Research Collective (FBRC)** [development kit website](https://fbrc.codeberg.page/rfb-dev-kit/). 

Why, you ask? The FBRC development kit and its instructions are **continuously evolving**. The official website will have the latest version of the kit and any related updates.
