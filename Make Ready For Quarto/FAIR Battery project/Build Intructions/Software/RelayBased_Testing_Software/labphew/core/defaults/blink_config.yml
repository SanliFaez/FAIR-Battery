  gui_refresh_time: 10   # (ms) How often gui checks if here's new data (usually quicker than time_step)

# Set parameters for the scan here
# This scan measure the state of the device a number of times with a specified interval time
scan:

  blink_period:         0.6 # (s) blink rate to set the device to
  time_between_points:  0.1 # (s) time between each datapoint
  number_of_points:     40  #     number_of_points * read_period determines the total duration of this scan
