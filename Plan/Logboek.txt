*Going to go through files and see what I can immediately add and see what seems to be missing.
 -->Build files are on another site, how can I access the raw files? 

--11-3-25--
*Meeting Sanli
*Tinker on site mechanics

--14-3-25--
*make local copy of github and start structuring attic and site make up.
*do same for the ones from fbrc.
 -->Takes more time than expected, since it I have to figure out the structure of the repository.
 -->Q for Sanli: How is the fbrc site different from what we want to accomplish? Important to know in order to know what to copy from fbrc.
 -->Going to use /main/docs/_site/ and find the corresponding files in /main/docs/ as template for copying files from fbrc, since this is what is actually on site.
    -->Made list of files as described above. Next time I want to look at these more closely in order to determine in what order they are needed. 
    -->make picture map.

--18-3-25--
*Plan: Continue sorting through fbrc files to see what order we need them. Copy all md files that from docs that are on the html list made last week.
 --> all files from html list are copied, exept for a few that weren't in docs. Probably are related to site layout, but first check what these files are. Afterwards I am going to sort the files in the right catogories.
--> a lot of files are still missing, so am now going to look for them in the repo --> Fixed, only the bill of material was not found in docs as an md file so I converted it.

*Idea: add more general home page.
*Plan: start adding the now sorted files into the site.
 --> Note: The pictures for fbrc are not yet copied, but will probably directly copy to quarto. Not sure if I can copy directories to quarto en just implement files without specifying path. Update: apperantly directory structure is kept, but this could actually be usefull. Will now structure directory so it will be more ready for quarto (do this in seperate forder)

--21-2-25--

*Plan: continue adapting the files to quarto.
       --> stl files arent being rendered. Will have to fix this later and will continue with implementing the other files.
        --> try and fix as much in the files as possible.
*Note: Right now there are fbrc files and fair battery project files which dont allign in a nice way. After fbrc is well implemented it is time to write new Fair battery files which make up a more coherent story for the project.

--25-3-25--
refer to fbrc, but explain parts etc. 


--28-3-25--
*Plan: Make list of componants we want to talk about in the build section. 

-> going to make a new complete structure for the site, so that it will be easier to have a overview of what I have to do.
-> Make directory to start making the correct files. From ./site_structured_sorting, take files that need little changing and place them in the correct subdirectory.
-> start reconfiguring files, starting at ./home. 
*Notes: People who visit this site will get a kit?

--1-4-25--
*Plan: continue making new documents, starting with Fair Battery Project: Main.
-> Made main and battery 101 (old version seemed proficient), will now mode on to componants, but since there is not a specific file for this, I will have to make a new one which I expect to take some time. Will make a list of what to discuss here.

-pumps
-arduino
-jig/ reservoirs
-flowcell

--10-4-25--
*plan: go on with componants part
-> no documents really explaining the componants, so will make it with info in battery 101. Also, will add links to different files on the site later on.

->questions for sanli: Why grafoil?
  Arduino no longer with driver motor. Ask sanli what to change

-> go on to fbrc project file.
-> add more pictures to files to make it more pleasant, but after the files are done.
-> updated home site.

*Important*: For the commity part for the site, I need more info like sites or what the general idea is. fbrc has their blog but fair-battery just says to e-mail sanli. How seperated are fbrc and fairbattery?
-> troubleshooting file

->Maybe add a extra page for credits, so I dont need to do it all throughout the site.
-> next time, implement what has been done so far into a quarto site, might need to restart that to make it have good structure and use previous version as a template.

--11-4-25--
*Plan: start implementing made docs to quarto site. 

Files that still have to be made: Beyond, testing, community, contributing.
- want the brite theme but is not included in quarto, might look into this

--22-4-25--
*Plan: -make list of what is still left to do.
       -make list of questions for Sanli.


-> Start updating battery 101.
-properties of functioning battery that can store energy.
 (pick up at potentiostat)
-Look at site customizations

--25-4-25--
Continue on with potentiostat. (revisit later, seems that filling the testing page takes priority right now.

filling testing page stucture:
1. testing home page
2. Frst_testing and charging
3. charge_Discharge_testing
4. Stability_Electrode(?)
 
Where to put scripts?

--29-4-25--
-Meeting Sanli answers to questions:
 -remake testing to refer to fbrc, give short explanation
 -community: No real community yet so refer to fbrc
 -contributing: No real way to contribute yet, but there is an active community at fbrc
 -beyond: not really a priority
 -testing: testing files of fairbattery are not up to date, again refer to fbrc
 
*Plan: -make mockup community and contribution page.
       -remake testing page

(forgot to log inbetween)

--10-5-25--
-from meeting sanli: -upload site
                     -post for feedback
                     -go to lili's proto lab to take pictures
                     -ask bacholar student to also give feedback
*plan: publish site and create post for feedback. Continue looking into how .css files work.

--13-5-25--
*plan: look at reaction and process them in a text file. Afterwards go on looking into how to change styles.ccs.
-No responds yet

--16-5-25--
*plan: look at reaction and process them in a text file. Afterwards, do some more research into fbrc.

-maybe want clear roadmap of FAIR Battery.

--27-5-25--
Follow up on sanli's request.

--6-6-25--
!Some days are missing but I was working on how yo add custom colors etc. to the standers styles provided by quarto in .scss files.

*Plan:
-Add new read_me to website repository that explains more about fairbattery itself.
-Add git link to site (on my pc before uploading) 
-fix hyperlink in build section
-Add video.

*Notes Krutesh:
-Update for new pumps (?)
-Change battery image
-Battery chemicals
