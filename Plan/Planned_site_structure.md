### In this file I will specify the planned structure for the Quarto site, in order to have a better overview of what has to be done

## Home:
Here there will be an overall overview of what the FAIR-Battery project is and what the site is for, who it is for, and how it is structured.

## Fair Battery Project:
Here we will explain the different components and redirect people to the FBRC site for the actual manufacturing of the battery. It will be structured as follows:

- **Main page**: Explanation of what will follow on this page and a guide to the FBRC site.
- **Battery 101**
- **Build** (only an overall list of the components and their function):
  1. Flow cell, gasket  
  2. Jig, reservoirs  
  3. Pumps  
  4. Microcontroller  
  5. Electrolyte solution  
- **FBRC Project**
- **Testing**
- **Troubleshooting**
- **Beyond**

## Community:
Here we will provide a way for readers to reach out and communicate about the project.

## Contributing to FAIR-Battery:
Here we will explain how people can join the project.
