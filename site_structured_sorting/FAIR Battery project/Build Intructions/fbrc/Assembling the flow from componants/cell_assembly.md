# Assembling the flow cell from components

Ensure you have the following components:
{{BOM}}

## Attach the tubing to the barbed fittings {pagestep}

Take the two [flow frames](fromstep){qty: 2} and attach one piece of [cut tubing](fromstep){qty: 4} to each barb. It should be a tight fit. You will only have to do this once.

## Insulate the bolts with packing tape {pagestep}

Wrap [polypropylene packing tape]{qty: several cm} around the shafts of the bolts, leaving the final 1 cm of threads exposed. 

>i **Note** 
>i
>i This prevents accidental short circuits of the cell from the bolt shafts contacting the grafoil.

## Insert the four bolts into positive endplate {pagestep}

Take one endplate and insert the four [M6 x 35 mm hex socket cap bolts with washers]{qty: 4}. This will be the positive endplate.

## Place the endplate on the cell assembly tool {pagestep}

Take the [cell assembly tool](fromstep){qty: 1} and place the endplate on it so that the exposed bolt threads point up.

## Add the brass current collector {pagestep}

Make sure the large tubing holes of the [current collector][brass current collectors](fromstep){qty: 1} align with the endplate.

## Add the negative grafoil current collector {pagestep}

Make sure the large tubing holes of the [grafoil current collector][grafoil current collectors](fromstep){qty: 1} align with the brass current collector.

## Add the negative outer gasket {pagestep}

Place one [outer gasket][outer gaskets](fromstep){qty: 1} on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the gasket and align it with the fluid holes in the cell body.

## Add the negative flow frame {pagestep}

Place one flow frame on top of the assembly, with the barbs and tubing facing downward into the cell assembly tool.

>? The total combined thickess of the flow frames and (compressed) gaskets is key to achieving the desired results! There are multiple thickness options in the `flow-frames` folder and custom thicknesses can be genererated from the FreeCAD files. The graphite felt should be compressed to 70% of it's original thickness. The compression is fixed by the combined total thickness of the flow frame and two gaskets.

## Add the negative nonconductive felt{pagestep}

Take one [cut nonconductive felt](fromstep){qty: 1} and add it to the assembly.

## Add the negative inner gasket{pagestep}

Take one [inner gasket][inner gaskets](fromstep){qty: 1} and add it to the assembly.

![](images/cell-assembly/g.jpg)

## Add the membranes {pagestep}

Take the three [cut membranes](fromstep){qty: 3} and add them to the assembly.

## Add the positive inner gasket{pagestep}

Take one [inner gasket][inner gaskets](fromstep){qty: 1} and add it to the assembly.

![](images/cell-assembly/i.jpg)

## Add the positive flow frame {pagestep}

Place one flow frame with tubing on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the flow frame.

![](images/cell-assembly/k.jpg)

## Add positive outer gasket {pagestep}

Place one [outer gasket][outer gaskets](fromstep){qty:1} on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the flow frame.

![](images/cell-assembly/l.jpg)

## Add positive graphite felt{pagestep}

Place one [graphite felt][cut electrodes](fromstep){qty:1} on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the flow frame.

![](images/cell-assembly/m.jpg)

## Add the positive grafoil current collector {pagestep}

Place the positive [grafoil current collector][grafoil current collectors](fromstep){qty: 1} over the flow frame.

![](images/cell-assembly/n.jpg)

## Add the positive brass current collector {pagestep}

Place the positive [current collector][brass current collectors](fromstep){qty: 1} on the cell as shown so the tab is facing opposite the negative current collector tab.

![](images/cell-assembly/o.jpg)

## Add the positive endplate {pagestep}

Place the second cell body (with barbs and brass plate installed) on top of the assembly and ensure all fluid holes are aligned. 

![](images/cell-assembly/p.jpg)

## Tighten the bolts {pagestep}

Hand-tighten four [M6 nuts with washers]{qty: 4} onto the exposed threads of the bolts in order to lightly compress the cell and hold all the components in place.

Progressively tighten the bolts to 5 Nâ‹…m in a [4-bolt flange pattern](https://www.flangeboltchart.com/torque-patterns/4-bolt-torque-pattern) using a [torque wrench]{qty: 1, cat: tool, Note: to accept 5 mm allen key or 10 mm hex socket} fitted with a [10 mm socket]{qty: 1, cat: tool, Note: To fit torque wrench} and a [5mm hex key]{qty: 1,cat: tool}

>i **Note** 
>i
>i Progressively tightening using a flange pattern is important to evenly compressing the cell and ensuring leak-free operation

**Nice work, now you have an [assembled flow cell]{output, qty:1}!**
