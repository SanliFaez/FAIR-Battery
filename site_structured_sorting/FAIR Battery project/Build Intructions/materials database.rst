Materials Database  [WIP]
******************

One of the main objectives of the FAIR-Battery project is to accommodate alternative chemistries or materials as much as
possible, and therefore remain versatile and varied.

Since a great strength of this project is the repeatability and comparability it provides redox-flow battery research,
a database for doing exactly that has been created. Once a battery has been tested (see :doc:`testing a unit`), the
results can be submitted into the database for analysis.
