# Preparing the electrolyte


>! **Caution** 
>!
>! From this point onwards, chemical safety risks are present. **You** are responsible for your own safety! Use proper PPE and do not perform anything you are not comfortable with. These instructions are presented as-is with no guarantee of your safety or assumed liability. Work in a well-ventilated area, with someone else nearby aware that you are working with chemicals and able to assist or call for help if needed

{{BOM}}

## Put on your personal protective equipment (PPE) {pagestep}

Put on a [pair of chemical safety goggles]{qty: 1,cat: tool}, a [pair of nitrile gloves]{qty: 1,cat: tool}, wear close-toed shoes, and wear long pants/trousers! A lab coat is recommended.

## Weigh out the chemicals {pagestep}


In a [50 mL beaker]{qty: 1,cat: tool}, using a [scale]{qty: 1,cat: tool} and [weighing spatula]{qty: 1,cat: tool}, weigh out the following chemicals according to their quantities listed above:

* [zinc chloride]{qty: 2.8 grams,cat: chemical}
* [potassium iodide]{qty: 6.6 grams,cat: chemical}
* [potassium acetate]{qty: 3.0 grams,cat: chemical}
* [8% vinegar/acetic acid]{qty: 10.0 grams,cat: chemical}

## Mix the electrolyte {pagestep}

Add a [stir bar]{qty: 1,cat: tool} to the beaker and place it on a [stir plate]{qty: 1,cat: tool}. Mix at room temperature until all salts are dissolved.

## Store the electrolyte in an air-tight container {pagestep}

>!! **Warning** 
>!!
>!! Aqueous iodide is oxidized in solution by dissolved oxygen, turning the solution yellow/brown.

Transfer and store prepared electrolytes in a sealed [vial]{qty: 1,cat: tool, note: min. 20 mL} to minimize exposure to ambient air.
