# Operating and testing the cell

{{BOM}}

## Weigh and add electrolyte to the cell{pagestep}

Using a [5 mL syringe]{qty: 1,cat: tool} and the [scale]{qty: 1,cat: tool}, add 5 mL of electrolyte to each reservoir, weighing the syringe before and after injection to record the actual mass added to each reservoir. 

## Close the reservoirs{pagestep}

Using 19/22 silicone [septa][19/22 silicone septa](septa.md){qty: 2,cat: part}, close the reservoirs.

## Pre-circulate the electrolyte{pagestep}

Turn the pumps on and circulate the electrolytes for 15 min before applying any current.

>i This should allow enough time for the separator to become fully wetted with electrolyte and clear out any bubbles trapped in the cell/felts.

## Connect to the potentiostat and define cycling conditions{pagestep}

Typical conditions for current cell:

- Constant current charge at 30 mA/cmÂ² to fixed capacity (*e.g.* 25 Ah/L) with high voltage cutoff of 1.6V
- Constant current charge at same current density to 0 V
- Cycling nonstop to your heart's content, or something happens to end the test
