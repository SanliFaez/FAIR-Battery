# Stopping and disassembling the cell

Once your experiment has concluded, save your data files, power down and disconnect the potentiostat.

Stop the pumps and drain the electrolyte from the reservoirs into a waste container. Add water and run the pumps for several seconds to rinse the cell and tubing. Repeat until there is the drained solution is clear.

Dispose of chemical waste according to local regulations.

Take apart the cell. Make any observations you might have of the separator (note which way it was facing when you do so), positive and negative electrodes, *etc.*

Clean and store the reusable cell components.
