# Instructions Script_plot_overpotential.py

## To open a python script:
1. Download anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/
2. Within anaconda, launch Spyder
3. Open the script Integration.py script within Spyder

## How to use the script:
1. Under FILL IN within the script there are 4 places which you need to fill in. Fill in the measured *U* at U with the corresponding at *I* at I. As an example, if you measure *U* = 1 V, 2.5 V and 3 V respectively at *I* = 100 mA, 200 mA, 400 mA, fill in U = [1, 2.5 ,3] and I = [100, 200, 400]. If you for instance choose A instead as mA as unit, change I_unit = "mA" to I_unit = "A". The same can be done for V_unit if you want to portray your values with something else than V.

2. Run the script. There is a button for this somewhere above, but you can also use the shortcut F5.

3. A plot is generated showing the voltage as a function of current.
