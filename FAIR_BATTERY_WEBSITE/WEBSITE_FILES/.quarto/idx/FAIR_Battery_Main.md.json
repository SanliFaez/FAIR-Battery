Here, you'll find everything you need to design, build, and test your very own battery. Whether you're a beginner or have some prior knowledge of battery technology, this guide will walk you through the process step by step.\n\n### What to Expect\n\nWe have structured this guide into clear sections to help you navigate through the project with ease. By following along, you will gain both theoretical and practical insights into battery design and testing.\n\n1.  [Battery Build Up](Battery%20Build%20Up.md) – A fundamental introduction to battery chemistry. Before you start building, it's important to understand the basic principles that make batteries work (\\~5 min).\n\n2.  [Componants](Componants.md) – A breakdown of the parts you will be assembling for your battery. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall function of the battery, and we will briefly explain their purposes and how they interact with one another (\\~5 min).\n\n3.  [Build](FBRC_project.md) – Now that you have the necessary knowledge, it's time to construct your battery! For this, we will guide you to the Flow Battery Test Cell (FBRC) website, where you will find detailed step-by-step manufacturing instructions, including material specifications, assembly techniques and more (\\~4+ hours).\n\n4.  [Testing](Testing.md) – Once your battery is assembled, you’ll need to check if it is working correctly. We will outline key testing procedures, including voltage measurements, capacity assessments and more (\\~10 min preparation + several days running the experiment).\n\n5.  [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) – Encountering problems during assembly or testing? Don't worry! This section will provide solutions to frequently encountered issues and offer guidance on diagnosing and fixing potential errors.\n\n6.  [Beyond]() – Haven't had enough and want to do more? We will give you some additional challenges you can do to improve your knowledge! (Currently unavailable)\n\nWe hope this guide makes your journey into battery building exciting and accessible. Let’s get started and bring your FAIR-Battery to life!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"FAIR_Battery_Main.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
