    "text": "Compared to traditional batteries, where the anodes, cathodes, separators and electrolyte are all contained within one structure (think of the popular AA Battery), flow batteries have their electrolyte in separate electrolyte tanks, outside of the of the reaction cell. Whereas in traditional batteries the electrolyte is contained, flow batteries actively pump the electrolyte through an ion-selective membrane. This has a few advantages, such as that the capacity of a flow battery is easily scalable, for one can just increase the tank size and the electro-active materials are easily recoverable.\nFlow batteries are also stackable, where you can connect the two tanks to multiple cells to achieve a higher voltage.\nToo learn more about flow batteries, their advantages and implementations, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery_Schematic\n\n\nFig. 1 A schematic example of a Redox Flow Battery. All components described in the legend can be found in every RFB. The V(V)/V(II) to V(IV)/V(III) redox reaction is used as an example.\n\n\nThe electrolyte in a redox-flow battery is the solution in the battery containing the chemical compounds which hold the (chemical) potential energy of the cell. This energy can be released when these compounds undergo a redox-reaction. Below an example is given of 2 half reactions which together add up to one redox reaction [2][4].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nReaction\nΔE\n\n\n\n\n1\nV3+ + e- → V2+\n- 0.255 V vs. SHE\n\n\n2\nVO2+ + H2O → VO2+ + 2 H+ + e-\n1.004 V vs. SHE\n\n\n3\nV2+ + 2 VO2+ + 4 H+ → V3+ + 2 VO2+ + 2 H2O\n1.259 V\n\n\n\nTable 1\nReaction 1 and 2 are the half reactions after which the electric potential is given. Reaction 3 is the total reaction. The theoretical electric potential of reaction 3 is the difference in electric potential of the half reactions. One can see these energies are given in V, which is J/C.\n\n\n\nFollowing the example of Table 1, if one would add V3+ and VO2+ into a solution without a membrane, the electron transfer of the oxidizer VO2+ to the reducer V3+ would happen at the side of the reaction. However, in an electrochemical battery, one controls the electron flow in order to use its energy. By putting putting a membrane between the solution containing the oxidizer and the solution containing the reducer, one doesn’t allow the the oxidizer and reducer to be in direct contact. The electron transfer is happens via the so called electrodes (see Fig.1). In Fig. 1 at 5, a device can be added to be powered in case of discharge of the battery. In Fig.1 at 5, the charger can be located upon charging of the battery.\nThe material of the membrane should be chosen to be non-reactive to the components in the of electrolyte and it should be permeable to the right components. One often used categorization for membranes is the distinction between anion- and cathion-exchanged membranes [1]. In general, cathion-exchanged membranes are used for high power density applications, while anion-exchanged membranes offer easier transport management and higher efficiency. Cathion and anion membranes can be categorized under ion exchange membranes, for they filter charged particles. Other types of membranes are porous seperators, bilayer membranes and asymmetric membranes [3].\n\n\n\nAs briefly stated before, the current collector is the material at which the half reactions within the electrolyte take place. It can either offer or take up electrons. The current collector where the reduction reaction takes place is called the cathode. The current collector where the oxidation reaction takes place is called the anode. When charging the battery, the cathode is labeled as negative and the anode as positive. Upon discharge, the cathode becomes positive and the anode becomes negative. In Fig. 1, a discharging battery is shown. If the direction of current would be turn around, i.e. the battery would be charged, the labeling would be change by switching 1 and 2.\nTo get back tot the example of the vanadium half reactions upon discharge of the cell; V3+ + e- → V2+ would take place on the cathode, while VO2+ + H2O → VO2+ + 2 H+ + e- takes place on the anode. A cell converting chemical energy to electric energy (discharging) is called a galvanic cell. A cell converting electric energy to chemical energy (charging) is called an electrolytic cell.\nThe current collectors should sathisfy a few characteristics, depending on their specific use: - They should be inert to the electrolyte. This usually involves being inert to acidic environmemts. - They should be able to both offer and take up electrons to and from the electrolyte. - They should be low resistance - Ideally the should be porous to offer a large surface for the half reactions to take place.\n\n\n\nThe current conductor is the part of the battery which conducts the current from the current collector to the other side of the cell. This can be the same material as the current collector, but could also be another material.\nThe current conductor should sathisfy the following characteristics: - It have a low resistance - If the conductor is a different material than the current collector, there should be a good electron transmission between the material of the current collector and transmission\n\n\n\nThe pump is located outside of the cell. The pump chooses the direction and speed of the electrlyte flow. The system contains one pump per halfcell.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we will be discussing the properties of a functioning battery that can be used for energy storage. We will mainly be discussing some terms and properties that you will need in this project and that will effect battery performance.\n\n\nIn an electrochemical battery undergoing a redox reaction, overpotential refers to the difference between the thermodynamically predicted voltage and the actual voltage measured under operating conditions.\nWhen a battery is discharging and producing current, this results in a lower voltage than theoretically expected. Conversely, when charging a battery, more energy must be applied than the theoretical value to drive the reaction.\nThis occurs because a certain minimum voltage is required for electrolysis (interchange of electrons via the electrodes) to take place. The gap between this required voltage and the thermodynamically determined voltage is what defines the overpotential.\nOverpotentail is directly linked to a batteries efficiency.\n\n\n\nAlthough internal resistance is a somewhat generic term, as is only refers to a batteries natural predisposition to hinder current flow, we will discuss some of the sources that cause this hinder in flow.\nThe materials of which a battery is constructed greatly influence the internal resistance of the battery, as some materials are more conductive than other. Think for example of the conductivity of the electrolyte, separators or current collectors. These will all effect the resistance of the battery.\nExternal factors also contribute. Temperature for example can influence the reaction rate, effecting the batteries performance.\n\n\n\n\nIn this project, you will be constructing a test cell, but what exactly is the difference between a test cell and a battery, and why does that distinction matter?\nA test cell in our case is essentially a simplified, experimental version of a battery. It is designed for research and development purposes, where access to internal components are essential.\nBefore a fully functioning and finalized battery can be manufactured, a test cell must be built and carefully studied. This stage is critical because it allows for modification and iteration. You can test different types of materials, and monitor how they influence the cell’s performance. When something does not work to your standard, you can easily access the responsible componants\nThe ability to evaluate these changes in a controlled and measurable way is what makes test cells so important. By gathering data from repeated trials, you can improve the design, enhance efficiency, and prevent future failures, all before committing to the manufacture of a complete battery system.\n\n\n\nWhen your test cell is build, you will have to perform some test to make sure it is working as expected. Here we will give a some things you will be working with.\n\nPotentiostat: A potentiastat is a device that allows you to measure.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Fumatech, https://www.fumatech.com/en/products/membranes-redox-flow-batteries/\n[2] Molchanov, B.

For more detailed specifications, please refer to the FBRC website, linked in the FBRC section of this document.\n\n\nThe flow cell serves as the core of the battery system, where the crucial redox reactions take place, and the electrical current is generated. This component is integral to the functionality of the entire setup, as it facilitates the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy.\n\n\n\nBrass and Grafoil Current Collectors: As discussed in the Battery 101 section, current collectors are responsible for either accepting or donating electrons during the redox process. In this design, we use a combination of brass and grafoil. Brass is highly conductive, making it an excellent choice for current collection, while grafoil, under standard conditions, is chemically inert to the electrolyte, ensuring longevity and stable performance.\nPorous Graphite Felt: The porous graphite felt acts as the conductor within the flow cell. Its porous structure is key, as it provides a high surface area, allowing for increased reaction efficiency. This makes it ideal for facilitating the flow of electrons and ions during the redox process.\nSeparator Sheet Membrane: A critical component in electrochemical cells, the separator sheet membrane prevents direct contact between the different solutions in the flow cell,. In this setup, photo paper is used as the membrane due to its availability and cost-effectiveness.\n\nHere are some images of the flow cell:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo control the flow of the electrolyte solution within the system, two pumps are utilized. These pumps are connected to two reservoirs that hold the electrolyte solutions, and the flow rate is carefully regulated.\n\n\n\nPeristaltic Pumps: Small peristaltic pumps are employed in this project. These pumps function by squeezing a tube, moving the liquid through it in a controlled manner.\nControl via Microcontroller: The pumps are controlled by an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller, which regulates the electrolyte flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrocontroller\n\n\nAs mentioned, the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller regulates the flow of electrolyte solution. Arduino microcontrollers are easily programmable and very well documented, making it ideal for all sorts of projects.\n\n\n\nTo keep all components aligned and secure, a jig is used to hold everything in place. The jig ensures that the flow cell, pumps, reservoirs and microcontroller are all properly positioned and sturdy during operation. The complete jig with componants is found below.",

This component is integral to the functionality of the entire setup, as it facilitates the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy.\n\n\n\nBrass and Grafoil Current Collectors: As discussed in the Battery 101 section, current collectors are responsible for either accepting or donating electrons during the redox process. In this design, we use a combination of brass and grafoil. Brass is highly conductive, making it an excellent choice for current collection, while grafoil, under standard conditions, is chemically inert to the electrolyte, ensuring longevity and stable performance.\nPorous Graphite Felt: The porous graphite felt acts as the conductor within the flow cell. Its porous structure is key, as it provides a high surface area, allowing for increased reaction efficiency. This makes it ideal for facilitating the flow of electrons and ions during the redox process.\nSeparator Sheet Membrane: A critical component in electrochemical cells, the separator sheet membrane prevents direct contact between the different solutions in the flow cell,. In this setup, photo paper is used as the membrane due to its availability and cost-effectiveness.\n\nHere are some images of the flow cell:",

    "text": "Project pillars\nIn our vision, to create a truly accessible FAIR-Battery, we need to form a community, at the same time that we collect and share the technical knowledge necessary for making and maintaining an operational device. Therefore, we are building our activities on three pillars\n\n1- Learning together\nIn this interdisciplinary project, we identify the barriers to developing a truly FAIR-battery and envision the first steps to removing some of these barriers.\nIn particular, we look for the answers to these questions: - What range of energy storage capacities are required for the development of typical user groups and at what cost? - Which battery technologies can potentially address these demands? - Are the materials and technologies required for adopting the identified technologies available in the identified user groups? If not, which adjustments are needed? - What is the missing know-how and expertise for kick-starting the local development of pilot projects? - How to set up a distributed manufacturing and maintenance infrastructure for electricity storage?\n\n\n2- Battery Hardware\nAs of April 2024, we have produced and tested an initial battery design with a geometric cell area of 1cm^2 with the possibility to scale up to 10 cm^2.\nMore detailed documentation and files can be found here.\nThe current battery design has been tested using a MYSTAT, a small open-source potentiostat.\n\n\n3- Coordination and Maintenance\nA standard procedure for testing FAIR-Batteries is currently being developed. The main purpose of this standardization is to make results from different contributing groups easy to compare. In order to achieve this, both software and hardware has been developed to fit the testing needs of redox-flow batteries."

    "text": "Testing your battery cell\nNow that you have build your test cell, it is ready for testing! For this we refer you to again to the FBRC development website.\nA short summary of what the experiment will entail:\n\nLeak testing the cell: To ensure that your test cell has been properly assembled, it is essential to perform a leak test. This step will help you verify that all components are sealed correctly and that no electrolyte will escape during operation.\nOperating and testing the cell: Once your test cell has passed the leak check, the next step involves initiating its operation. Begin by carefully adding the appropriate electrolyte into your battery. After the electrolyte has been added, it should be pre-circulated throughout the entire cell system. Only after this pre-circulation process should you proceed to apply an electrical current. At this stage, connect your test cell to the potentiostat. Once the connection is established, you will then define the specific cycling conditions under which the cell will be tested.",
